<b>Project Organization</b>

For the datathon, we were required to discover and analyse patterns in football team performance and match outcomes, and make recommendations about optimal club construction based on data analysis.

Extensive exploratory data analysis was first conducted to evaluate possible relationships and correlations between various variables in the provided datasets. 
We found the player potential data to be particularly interesting, thus we decided to explore its usefulness in helping football clubs optimise their teams. To do so, we collected extra data on football players such as their salary, as well as league data. This allowed us to obtain greater insights on the effects of the player potential variable.
Finally, we decided to create a model to predict the future potential of up and coming footballers with Machine Learning.
